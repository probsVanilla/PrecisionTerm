## Precision Terminal

A terminal built for the best of the best. Code faster, smarter, and cleaner with OloAI at your side.

# Intuitive Design

Precision is simple enough for beginners, yet powerful for pros. Run any command suite, automate workflows, and code like never beforeâ€”all with built-in AI assistance.

# Olo + Precision AI

Olo is powered by Meta LLaMa 3.1 8B Instruct.

Local Install Size: ~4.58 GB

Optional: Run LLaMa locally, or connect via OpenAI by entering:


"olo openapi your-key"


Offline Mode uses your CPU + RAM; if you have a Neural Engine, Precision will leverage it automatically.
